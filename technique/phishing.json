  "description": "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.\n\nGenerative AI, including LLMs that generate synthetic text, visual deepfakes of faces, and audio deepfakes of speech, is enabling adversaries to scale targeted phishing campaigns. LLMs can interact with users via text conversations and can be programmed with a meta prompt to phish for sensitive information. Deepfakes can be use in impersonation as an aid to phishing.",
